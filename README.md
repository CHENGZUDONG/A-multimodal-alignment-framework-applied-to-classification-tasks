## Pre-trained Model

To utilize the pre-trained model for the experiments, please download the parameters from the following link:

**[Download Pre-trained Parameters](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16p-3WKTbaLRF0p9Uzcdl3dKf3svekCzQ/view?usp=sharing)**

Once downloaded, you can integrate the parameters into your project by following the instructions in the `model.ipynb` file.

## Dataset Information

This framework is built on publicly available datasets, and references to the datasets can be found in the accompanying research paper. The data used in the experiments is suitable for various classification tasks, and the model can be customized for other datasets as needed.

---

## Customization and Adaptation

Due to hardware limitations during development, the framework is designed to allow users to modify the parameters for their own datasets. For detailed instructions on how to adjust the parameters, please refer to the `bert+vit.ipynb` file included in this repository.
